Mini Bookstore Management System (Java)

📌 Project Overview

The **Mini Bookstore Management System** is a Java-based application designed to manage basic bookstore operations such as handling books, customers, and sales.
The project focuses on applying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and core Java concepts to build a structured, modular, and scalable application.

This project is ideal for showcasing **Java fundamentals**, **OOP skills**, and **problem-solving ability** for software development roles.
